# Performance_Optimisation
Apply the skills learned for optimisation of graphics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to take a poorly optimised site and reduce the total load size to under 1.3mb and total requests to less than 27. Students will need to analyse the assets they've been provided to see where optimisations can and need to be made, make those optimisations, and measure their success. Multiple analysis, optimisation, and measuring cycles may be required.
